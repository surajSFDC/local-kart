## What This Project Does

1. **Generate Professional Profiles**: Convert natural language descriptions into structured service provider profiles
2. **Multilingual Support**: Provide search and interface in multiple Indian languages
3. **Smart Matching**: Use AI to match customers with the right service providers based on location, service type, and requirements
4. **Booking System**: Handle service bookings with real-time updates
5. **Communication**: In-app messaging between customers and providers
